		<p>Hi Everyone , I am indian keeping  myself anonymous . If you came to this page searching about bitcoin trading investment by any random trader then please do not invest anything . This post will be long but please be patient and read it all as it will save lots of money and time. I was scammed by a proclaimed random expert trader  on a fast trade option platform.Please my humble request is to read all as I know I am going through lots of debt because of this . i lost around 2500$ which means exactly 1.5 Lacs in INR. I am dividing my whole incident in different sections how I met and stuck into this trap.If you have not given any money to the unknown trader then please do not invest anything and if you have invested some money then don't pay anymore as you will go into more deep shit. Please ignore my bad english and look and feel of the post. I am keeping it more simple and powerful so no other people will lose money.</p>

		<h2 class="sectionhead">How I Met Expert Trader</h2>
		<p>I met Joe Maria on linkedin and it started with normal hi and hello then she jumped on investment schemes .  The scheme was if i invest 100 i will get 1000$ in a two week and 10% will be brokerage charge.So i agreed to pay 100$ via bitcoin . I have even asked her only 10% brokerage is to be given nothing else ? she replied yes nothing else.</p>
		<h2 class="sectionhead">Luring Into Trap</h2>
		<p>I have logged into fast trade options and I saw the next day my 100 $ become 1000$ ,  Really on the next day ! I was happy and started calculating what I can build with this money (greedy mind).After three day it became more than   $30k , yes i was into shock .on 4th day it was showing my account is lock and when i asked joe about this she said ohh i am sorry i forget to tell you about this . (first lie if a person is trading on this platform how can she forget ). So she said I have to pay 1000$ to unlock it for 1 month and it was a whole year package. what i told her to pay for me and i will give my half $15k she did not agree on this now i know because this is all fake. Now the trap game started like you. My mind was saying pay her 1000$ and get the 32k.What i told her i will give referrals of my friend if she pay for me so she said you will get only $1k after 15 days and yes she has given me $1k . So i thought i will invest 100 and keep rest but she said i have to invest more than 900$ otherwise my account will get locked again .I referred my two friends and both invested 100$ and even I had invested back that 900$. I thought she is genuine. Even i asked her is there any more fees on withdrawal on which she said no there are no more fees now . So i was happy . </p>
		<h2 class="sectionhead">Never Ending Withdrawl Process</h2>
		<p>After the second 900$ investment my money became 32K and i was happy that this time i can withdraw all . I made a withdrawal request of 32k and I got mail that I have to pay $2.5k as tax . I was shocked and argued with her why i got another request of demanding more money so she said i forget to tell you (even i asked during investment she said no more money required for withdrawal). here i know now I wont get my money . My other friend's money became $20K so he got the same mail that paid tax $2k . What we thought, let's contribute and pay (greedy mind ) we will divide later. So somehow we managed $2k and paid her .After paying the money she said you will receive profit in 3 hours but she went off for 3 days and suddenly we got another mail that the referral has to pay tax . Now we were into more deep shit.</p>
		<h2 class="sectionhead">Commitment And Fake Promises</h2>
		<p>Even she promised that we will get profit ( I am referring here as we as me and my friend ). When we got the mail of referral tax pay , the reply was development has happened and they changed the terms and condition . I was like , how can development happen after my payment and nothing will develop in a day . I argued for 2 month on this and finally I am writing this blog . Here the point is she promised that if any new thing will come she will return the money but as you know this was all fake . I would like to tell you that  they give silly reasons like development and company policy changes but you will notice that everything will happen after the payment .</p>
		<h2 class="sectionhead">IBPC Certificate Trap</h2>
		<p>After someday my friend argued with her to return money then said she has started working in a new firm paymasteroption.com . So terms and conditions for this website was a minimum 500$ investment and no tax , no brokerage . The point is now she is trying to pull us into a new website and forgetting about the old site. So we created one fake profile and contacted her on linkedin . And you won't believe she agreed on 100$ investment on a new website . we have asked her that there is any requirement for withdrawal on which she said no .So after a week 100 became some thousands and when we made a withdrawal request we got mail that for withdrawal investors need an IBPC certificate . Again we argued and the reply was I forgot to tell . So what we  have taken IBPC from another trader and submitted for withdrawal on which she said you have to take a certificate from us then it will be valid ( if the certificate is universal then it can not be a monopoly of any one ) and the certificate cost was $2500 . And apart from this she made two time profiles on linkedin and both were reported and blocked by linkedin on which she said it was hacked (LOL). I don't know whether she is actually male or female because Mr Fredrick's name is even more famous for fast trade fraud . And you won't believe Joe maria linkdin gmail was fredrik . I will share a snapshot of that even . When asked why fredrick mail so on chich she said it is of my husband.</p>
		<h2 class="sectionhead">Should You Invest Or Not ?</h2>
		<p>If you think any trader is genuine then ask for a virtual or zoom meeting . On which they will say no I can not . Ask for a brokerage licence and check whether it is regulated or not.because these people use photos of some random person and will never show their real face . So final words are  fast trade option and paymasteroption on which joe maria or mrfredrick are working not legit . They might show you some video links of people . Ask them can i talk to this person on which they will say they can not share the person's name as it is against the policy . And In short do not invest or give money to any random trader without knowing the real identity virtually .</p>
		<h2 class="sectionhead">Final Word</h2>
		<p>My final words are if they can actually make this much money then they should be the Top 10 richest people in the world and if they are getting this much money then why one needs to convince people to invest is really weird for 10% brokerage they are chatting with us all time . If they are genuine then come to instagram host some live event but they will use more words on whatsapp. So please please if you came to this page before investment then congratulation you saved lots of money and time . If you are in a trap don't be greedy and get off this loop and post your story on social media so more and more people will be aware . If you are indian invest on indian stock market or Use IQ options or some other authentic and regulated website.In the future people might come up with different website and username but remeber all the strategies will be same. </p>
